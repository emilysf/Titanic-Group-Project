                   	<h3> Titanic is a 1997 American epic romantic disaster film directed, written, co-produced, and co-edited by James Cameron. A fictionalized account of the sinking of the RMS Titanic, it stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as members

                    of different social classes who fall in love aboard the ship during its ill-fated maiden voyage. <br><br> 

Cameron's inspiration for the film came from his fascination with shipwrecks; he felt a love story interspersed with the human loss would be essential to convey the emotional message of the disaster. Production began in 1995, when Cameron shot footage of the actual Titanic wreck.

The modern scenes on the research vessel were shot on board the Akademik Mstislav Keldysh, which Cameron had used as a base when filming the wreck. Scale models, computer-generated imagery, and a reconstruction of the Titanic built at Playas de Rosarito in Baja California were used to re-create the sinking. <br><br>The film was partially funded by Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox; at the time, it was the most expensive film ever made, with an estimated budget of $200 million. <br><br>

<strong>The success of the film:</strong> Upon its release on December 19, 1997, Titanic achieved critical and commercial success. Nominated for fourteen Academy Awards, it tied All About Eve (1950) for the most Oscar nominations, and won eleven, including the awards for Best Picture and Best Director, tying Ben Hur (1959) for the most Oscars won by a single film. <br><br>With an initial worldwide gross of over $1.84 billion, Titanic was the first film to reach the billion-dollar mark. It remained the highest-grossing film of all time until Cameron's 2009 film Avatar surpassed it in 2010. A 3D version of Titanic, released on April 4, 2012 to commemorate the centennial of the sinking, earned it an additional $343.6 million worldwide, pushing the film's worldwide total to $2.18 billion. It became the second film to gross more than $2 billion worldwide (after Avatar).</h3>

		<h2> Titanic 2 Cruise Ship (2018) </h2> 
        	<h3>
            <strong>Titanic 2 cruise ship</strong> – the world’s most waited vessel, fascinates and inspires the imagination of millions of people around the world. Titanic replica ship – the stunning project to revive the RMS Titanic dream, is a brainchild of one of the richest people in Australia, a multimillion mining magnate and an adventurous visionary unmatched around the world-Clive Palmer.<br><br>

            </div>

<br>           
On April the 30th 2012, on a special press conference Palmer astonished and shocked the world announcing his bold intention to create a full-scale replica of Titanic. The new Titanic 2 ship will offer 840 cabins and the capacity to host 2,435 passengers and 900-crew.
			<br><br>
            Clive Palmer has already signed (in April 2012) a memorandum of understanding with one of the top ship-building companies in the world the Chinese state owned CSC Jinling to construct a replica of RMS Titanic, the Titanic II ship. The vessel will be built in China and will set sail in late 2016.
            <br><br>
            The new Titanic 2 ship is expected to be launched in 2018. The new ship will be 833 feet long, just three inches longer than the original and 4.2m (13.9ft) wider in order to increase stability. Titanic 2 ship will have a two sectioned bridge. The forward section is designed to be an original RMS Titanic replica and the aft section a high technology bridge with all the available features in 2018.
<br><br>
A new extra “Safety deck” between original decks D and C is projected for 18  lifeboats and the safety chutes. It’s not yet decided whether there will be garage or cars on-deck storage on board. New Titanic 2 ship will have all the safety certificates, including of course SOLAS.
            
            <br><br>
             Along with the re-inventing of the Titanic ship, there are many exhbitions held all over the world where guests will are able to experience the Titanic. Dinner shows have also become a popular source of entertainment and a great way to interact with guests who are fascinated by the story of the Titanic and are held all over the world. <br><br>
